# Available Question Count Fix - Complete Solution

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the issue with the available question count functionality and the solution implemented.

## Problem Summary

Users were experiencing an error "No active questions available in this section" when creating practice tests. The backend was returning a 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error when the frontend attempted to fetch the count of available questions via the `/questions/available-count` endpoint.

### Error Details

1. In the frontend, when selecting a section in the Practice Test page, the application would call the `/questions/available-count` endpoint with `paper_id` and `section_id` parameters
2. The backend would return a 422 error
3. The frontend would default to showing 0 available questions with an error message

## Root Cause Analysis

The backend endpoint `/questions/available-count` was using a non-existent field in its query:

```python
# Problematic code
query = db.query(func.count(Question.question_id)).filter(
    Question.paper_id == paper_id,
    Question.is_active == True  # This field doesn't exist in the Question model
)
```

In the actual database schema, questions use a `valid_until` date field to determine if they're active, not an `is_active` boolean field.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive solution with multiple components:

### 1. Backend Fix

Updated the endpoint to use the correct field for determining active questions:

```python
query = db.query(func.count(Question.question_id)).filter(
    Question.paper_id == paper_id,
    Question.valid_until >= date.today()  # Correct field to determine active questions
)
```

We also added improved error handling and logging:
- Detailed parameter validation
- Explicit error messages for each failure case
- Better logging for debugging purposes
- Handling of non-existent paper/section/subsection IDs gracefully

### 2. Frontend Improvements

Enhanced the API service to handle errors better:
- Better error reporting and logging
- Parameter validation before making the request
- Fallback behavior when errors occur

Improved the Practice Test page component:
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- Better state management for available counts

## Testing the Solution

We created comprehensive test scripts and documentation:
1. A robust test script to verify all endpoint scenarios
2. Manual testing instructions
3. Documentation of both the issue and solution

## Expected Behavior After Fix

With our solution in place:
1. The `/questions/available-count` endpoint should properly return the count of questions where `valid_until >= today`
2. No 422 errors should be thrown by the backend
3. The frontend should display the correct count of available questions
4. Users should get clear feedback about question availability
5. The system should prevent attempts to create tests with more questions than are available

## Future Recommendations

1. Add comprehensive unit tests for the endpoint
2. Consider adding an explicit `is_active` field to the Question model if this is a common access pattern
3. Implement additional validation on the frontend to prevent errors earlier in the workflow
4. Consider caching question counts on the server side to improve performance
