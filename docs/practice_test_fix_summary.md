# Practice Test Question Count Fix

This document summarizes the complete solution for fixing the "Not enough active questions available for the test" error in the Practice Test feature.

## Problem Summary

Users were experiencing an error when creating practice tests: "Not enough active questions available for the test". This happened because:

1. The frontend was not checking the available question count before submitting the request
2. The backend API endpoint `/questions/available-count` was returning a 422 error due to an incorrect field reference
3. No proper validation or error handling was in place to prevent this situation

## Solution Overview

The solution addressed both frontend and backend components:

### Frontend Fixes

1. **Available Question Count Integration**:
   - Added API calls to fetch available question counts for each section
   - Implemented caching of counts to reduce API calls
   - Added UI elements to display available counts to users

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Restricted question count inputs based on available questions
   - Added max attributes to number inputs
   - Implemented comprehensive validation before submitting

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added clear error messages when not enough questions are available
   - Implemented better user guidance throughout the test creation process

### Backend Fixes

1. **API Endpoint Fix**:
   - Fixed the `/questions/available-count` endpoint to use the correct field (`valid_until >= date.today()` instead of the non-existent `is_active`)
   - Ensured consistent filtering across all question-related endpoints

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Better error logging and handling for the endpoint

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `frontend/src/pages/PracticeTestPage.tsx` (major edits to UI, state, validation, API integration)
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (API call for available question count)

### Backend:
- `backend/src/routers/questions.py` (fix for available-count endpoint)

### Documentation:
- `backend/docs/available_question_count_fix.md` (detailed documentation of the backend fix)
- `docs/practice_test_fix_summary.md` (comprehensive solution documentation)

## Testing

The solution has been tested through:

1. **Backend API Tests**:
   - Direct API tests with authentication tokens
   - Manual testing scripts provided

2. **Frontend Testing**:
   - UI validation testing
   - API integration tests
   - User flow testing

## Benefits

The implemented solution:

1. **Improves User Experience**:
   - Shows available question counts to users
   - Prevents frustrating errors during test creation
   - Provides clear guidance on test constraints

2. **Enhances System Stability**:
   - Reduces backend errors
   - Prevents invalid requests from being submitted
   - Implements proper validation throughout

3. **Maintains Data Integrity**:
   - Ensures tests are only created with valid questions
   - Validates all parameters before submission

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for the API endpoints
   - Implement automated UI tests for the practice test workflow

2. **Database Improvements**:
   - Consider adding an explicit `is_active` column for questions if that's a common access pattern
   - Review other potential inconsistencies in the schema vs. code

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Add a "refresh" button to update available question counts
   - Implement dynamic section options that hide sections with insufficient questions
