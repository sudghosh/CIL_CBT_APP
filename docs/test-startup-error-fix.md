# Test Startup Error Fix

## Issue Summary

Users were experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to start both adaptive and non-adaptive tests, with the following error message in the console:
`Failed to start test: Internal server error occurred when starting the test.`

## Root Cause Analysis

After comprehensive investigation, we determined the error occurred because:

1. The backend was trying to store the `max_questions` value in the `TestAttempt` model 
2. The `max_questions` column did not exist in some database deployments
3. There was no graceful error handling for the case when this column is missing
4. The error affected all test starts, not just adaptive tests that use the max_questions field

## Fix Implementation - June 17, 2025

### Database Migration
1. Applied the `add_max_questions_column.py` migration script to add the missing column
2. Script includes safety checks to only add the column if it doesn't exist

### Backend Changes

1. **Added New Route Handler**:
   - Created `start_route.py` with improved error handling
   - Properly registered the route in the FastAPI app
   - Modified the `start_test` function in `tests.py` to only set the `max_questions` value if the attribute exists
   - Added robust error handling to gracefully continue if the column doesn't exist

2. **Added Database Migration Script**:
   - Created `add_max_questions_column.py` to add the `max_questions` column to the `test_attempts` table
   - The script checks if the column already exists before trying to add it

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Improved the error handling in the `next_question` endpoint to gracefully handle missing `max_questions` values
   - Added detailed logging to help with future debugging

### Frontend Changes

No frontend changes were required, as the issue was entirely on the backend.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Stop the backend service if it's running
2. Run the `apply_max_questions_fix.bat` script to:
   - Apply the database migration
   - Restart the backend service

## Testing Verification

After applying the fix, verify that:

1. You can successfully start both adaptive and non-adaptive tests
2. Adaptive tests properly respect the `max_questions` limit
3. Test completion works as expected

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always include database migration scripts when adding new columns
2. Add robust error handling for database operations
3. Implement graceful fallbacks for missing fields
4. Improve test coverage for the test starting functionality

## Related Changes

This fix is related to the adaptive test feature implementation that adds support for limiting the number of questions in a test. The `max_questions` field is used to track this limit and enforce it during test progression.
