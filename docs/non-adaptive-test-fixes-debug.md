# Non-Adaptive Test Debug and Fixes

## Problem Description

The non-adaptive test component had issues with MCQ options not displaying correctly, particularly for the first question. The issue was observed as:

1. MCQ options not showing for the first question
2. React key warnings: "Encountered two children with the same key, `option-undefined`"

## Root Causes

1. **Data Format Inconsistency**: Backend API returns options as a string array, but frontend expects an object array
2. **Incomplete Normalization**: The existing normalization function didn't handle all edge cases
3. **Key Generation Issues**: The keys for React components weren't unique, causing warnings and potential rendering issues

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Question Normalization

Improved the `normalizeQuestionFormat` function to:
- Handle multiple input formats (null values, string arrays, object arrays)
- Add comprehensive logging
- Normalize consistently across the component
- Add proper fallback values for missing properties

### 2. Improved Rendering Logic

- Added immediate normalization of the current question right before rendering
- Used IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) in JSX to add better logic isolation
- Added comprehensive logging for each option being rendered
- Improved unique key generation with question ID included

### 3. Debug Features

Added development-only features to help diagnose issues:
- Debug panel showing current question data
- Rich console logging of normalization steps
- Option-by-option rendering logs

## Verification Steps

After implementing these changes, verify:

1. MCQ options show properly for the first question in non-adaptive tests
2. No React key warnings appear in the console
3. Options remain consistent as you navigate through questions
4. The debug panel shows correct information in development mode
