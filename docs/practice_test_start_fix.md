# Practice Test Issue Fix Documentation

## Problem Overview

The Practice Test feature was failing when trying to start a test with certain sections, causing a 500 error when creating a template with multiple sections and then a 400 error when starting the test with a message: "Not enough active questions available for the test".

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Invalid Field in Database Query**:
   - The backend was using `Question.is_active == True` which does not exist in the schema
   - The correct field is `Question.valid_until >= date.today()`

2. **Missing Error Handling**:
   - The error messages didn't provide enough detail to diagnose which sections had issues
   - Insufficient logging to track section-specific question counts

3. **Frontend Validation**:
   - The frontend wasn't properly checking for real availability of questions for sections
   - When some sections had zero questions, this was leading to template creation but test start failure

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes:

1. **Fixed Database Query**:
   - Replaced `Question.is_active == True` with `Question.valid_until >= date.today()`
   - Added proper handling of `null` values for section_id and subsection_id

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error messages showing which sections had insufficient questions
   - Added comprehensive logging to track question counts per section
   - Improved validation to better detect sections with zero questions

### Frontend Changes:

1. **Improved Validation**:
   - Added additional checks for section validity using cached error information
   - Added better error messages when a section doesn't have enough questions

2. **Enhanced Error Reporting**:
   - Added specific error messages for different error scenarios
   - Improved logging across components

## Testing and Verification

The changes have been tested with:
- Valid sections with enough questions
- Valid sections with insufficient questions
- Non-existent sections
- Mixed combinations of valid and invalid sections

The solution now provides clear error messages in all cases and prevents attempting to start tests when there aren't enough questions available.

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Database Schema Alignment**:
   - Update all code references to use `valid_until` instead of `is_active`
   - Consider adding a database view that simplifies active question querying

2. **Improved Frontend Validation**:
   - Add a pre-check validation step before attempting to create a template
   - Cache available question counts for sections to reduce API load

3. **Error Handling Best Practices**:
   - Continue expanding the error messages to be more user-friendly
   - Add more detailed logging for all error cases
