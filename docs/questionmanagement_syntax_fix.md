# QuestionManagement.tsx Syntax Fix

## Issue Description

A syntax error was causing the frontend application to crash with the following error:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected "," (324:14)
 322 |       setSubsections([]);
 323 |     }
>324 |   }, [formData.section_id]);
```

The error occurred because two useEffect hooks were improperly separated in the QuestionManagement.tsx file.

## Root Cause

In the QuestionManagement.tsx file, the closing of one useEffect hook and the beginning of another were not properly separated, causing a syntax error. The problematic code was:

```typescript
}, [page]); // Depends on page state  // Fetch subsections when section changes  useEffect(() => {
```

This code attempted to place a comment and start a new useEffect on the same line as the closing of the previous useEffect, which is invalid JavaScript/TypeScript syntax.

## Solution

We fixed the issue by properly formatting the code with appropriate line breaks:

```typescript
}, [page]); // Depends on page state
  
// Fetch subsections when section changes
useEffect(() => {
```

This ensures that:
1. The first useEffect hook is properly closed
2. There's a clean line break between the hooks
3. The comment for the second useEffect is on its own line
4. The second useEffect starts on a new line

## Best Practices

When writing React components with multiple hooks:

1. **Proper Formatting**: Always separate hooks with clear line breaks
2. **Consistent Indentation**: Maintain consistent indentation for better readability
3. **Clear Comments**: Place explanatory comments on their own lines, not at the end of code lines
4. **Code Organization**: Group related useEffect hooks together but with clear separation

## Verification

After applying the fix and restarting the frontend service, the application should compile and run without syntax errors.
