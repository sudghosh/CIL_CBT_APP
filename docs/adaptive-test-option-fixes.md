# Adaptive Test and Question Option Display Fixes

## Overview

This documentation covers fixes for two issues in the CIL CBT App test system:

1. In both non-adaptive and adaptive tests, question options were displayed as generic "Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, Option 4" instead of showing the actual option text.
2. Adaptive tests did not end after the specified number of questions were answered, continuing until the time limit was reached.

## Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Option Display Problem

#### Root Cause
The backend was not correctly retrieving option text from the `QuestionOption` model, and instead was assuming the presence of non-existent attributes like `option_1_text` on the `Question` model. The frontend fallback logic was then displaying generic "Option X" placeholders.

#### Fix
1. Modified the `/tests/questions/{attempt_id}` endpoint to properly query the `QuestionOption` table for option text.
2. Updated the `TestAnswerResponse` model to correctly retrieve and return option text from the database.
3. Ensured proper handling of options in both legacy (direct fields) and modern (related models) formats.

### Issue 2: Adaptive Tests Not Ending After Max Questions

#### Root Cause
The `max_questions` limit was set in the database, but the test would only end when the time limit was reached, not when the maximum number of questions were answered.

#### Fix
1. Enhanced the `get_next_adaptive_question` endpoint to:
   - Properly check if the questions answered have reached the max_questions limit
   - Automatically complete the test and calculate the score when the limit is reached
   - Return a proper "complete" status to the frontend

2. Updated the AdaptiveTestInterface component to:
   - Check for "complete" status returned from the backend
   - Verify the max_questions limit client-side as well
   - Finish the test automatically when the limit is reached

## Technical Details

### Option Display Fix
- Now using proper relationship query: `db.query(QuestionOption).filter(QuestionOption.question_id == question.question_id).order_by(QuestionOption.option_order)`
- Maintaining backward compatibility with legacy question formats
- Improved frontend handling of different option formats

### Adaptive Test Completion Fix
- Added automatic test completion in backend when `questions_answered >= max_questions`
- Added score calculation on automatic completion
- Enhanced frontend to recognize server "complete" status
- Added client-side verification of max_questions limit

## Testing and Verification

### Manual Testing
To verify these fixes are working correctly:

1. For option display:
   - Start a non-adaptive test and verify options show actual text, not "Option X" placeholders
   - Start an adaptive test and verify the first and subsequent questions show proper options

2. For adaptive test completion:
   - Create an adaptive test template with a specified max_questions limit
   - Start the test and answer the specified number of questions
   - Verify the test automatically completes after answering the maximum number of questions

### Automated Verification
A PowerShell script (`verify_test_fixes.ps1`) has been created to automatically verify both fixes:

1. The script performs the following checks:
   - Restarts the backend container to ensure the latest code is used
   - Creates a test attempt with a specified max_questions limit (5)
   - Checks if question options are properly displayed (not generic placeholders)
   - Submits answers to reach the max_questions limit
   - Verifies that the test automatically completes when the limit is reached

2. To run the verification script:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Path\To\CIL_CBT_App
   .\verify_test_fixes.ps1
   ```

3. Expected output:
   - "FIX 1 VERIFICATION PASSED" indicates options are properly displayed
   - "FIX 2 VERIFICATION PASSED" indicates adaptive test completes after max_questions

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider implementing a standard format for question options to avoid the need for fallback logic
- Add more comprehensive logging for adaptive test flow to aid in troubleshooting
- Consider adding a visual indicator in the UI showing progress (questions answered/max questions)
