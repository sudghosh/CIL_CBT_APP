# Adaptive Test Interface Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented in the Adaptive Test Interface component to resolve several issues with the test-taking flow.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Option Display Issue (June 17, 2025)**
   - **Problem**: In both non-adaptive and adaptive tests, question options were displayed as generic "Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, Option 4" instead of showing the actual option text.
   - **Fix**: 
     - Modified backend endpoints to properly query the QuestionOption table for option text
     - Enhanced frontend option normalization and display logic
     - See full details in [adaptive-test-option-fixes.md](./adaptive-test-option-fixes.md)

2. **Adaptive Test Not Ending After Max Questions (June 17, 2025)**
   - **Problem**: Adaptive tests did not end after the specified number of questions were answered, continuing until the time limit was reached.
   - **Fix**:
     - Enhanced backend to check question count against max_questions limit and automatically complete tests
     - Updated frontend to recognize "complete" status from backend
     - Added verification script to validate fixes
     - See full details in [adaptive-test-option-fixes.md](./adaptive-test-option-fixes.md)

3. **500 Internal Server Error on Test Start (June 17, 2025)**
   - **Problem**: Both adaptive and non-adaptive tests were failing with 500 errors when attempting to start a test due to missing database column.
   - **Fix**: 
     - Added `max_questions` column to database via migration script
     - Created a new route handler with robust error handling
     - See full details in [test-startup-error-fix.md](./test-startup-error-fix.md)

2. **Infinite Render Loop**
   - **Problem**: The component was re-rendering infinitely due to the timer effect having a dependency on `handleSubmitTest` which updates state.
   - **Fix**: Separated the timer effect from the question fetch effect, removed `handleSubmitTest` from dependencies, and used a direct API call for timeout case.

3. **Options Not Displaying for First Question**
   - **Problem**: The component was not properly handling different format of options (string arrays vs object arrays) from the backend.
   - **Fix**: Added a `normalizeQuestionFormat` function to convert different option formats into the expected format. Also added explicit type checking.

4. **404 Error on Next Question API Call**
   - **Problem**: The component was failing with 404 errors when calling the adaptive `POST /tests/<id>/next_question` endpoint.
   - **Fix**: 
     - For the first question, we now properly use the standard `getQuestions` endpoint
     - For subsequent questions, ensured correct POST method for `/tests/<id>/next_question`
     - Added fallback mechanisms to handle potential API errors

4. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Added robust error handling throughout the component
   - Gracefully handles API errors
   - Added fallback mechanisms for test completion

5. **Questions Limit Implementation (Updated June 17, 2025)**
   - **Problem**: Adaptive tests didn't automatically end when the user reached their selected number of questions
   - **Fix**: 
      - Added `max_questions` field to `TestAttempt` model in backend
      - Fixed issue with non-existent `is_active` attribute causing errors
      - Enhanced max_questions retrieval logic with multiple fallbacks
      - Fixed option validation for selected_option_id
      - See detailed documentation in [adaptive-test-max-questions-fix.md](./adaptive-test-max-questions-fix.md)

6. **Results Summary Enhancement**
   - **Problem**: No detailed summary of correct/incorrect answers shown after test completion
   - **Fix**: Enhanced the `ResultsPage` component to display totals and percentages, plus visual indicators for correct/incorrect answers
   
7. **Test Startup Error Fix** (New - June 17, 2025)
   - **Problem**: 500 Internal Server Error when trying to start a test (both adaptive and non-adaptive)
   - **Fix**: 
     - Added conditional setting of `max_questions` in the `start_test` function
     - Created migration script to add the missing column to the database
     - Enhanced error handling to gracefully continue if the column doesn't exist
     - See full details in [test-startup-error-fix.md](./test-startup-error-fix.md)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Changes

1. **Timer Logic**
   - Separated timer useEffect from question fetching to prevent dependency cycles
   - Removed handleSubmitTest from dependencies to avoid re-renders

2. **Option Format Normalization**
   - Added `normalizeQuestionFormat` function to convert between different option formats
   - Ensures options always render correctly regardless of backend format

3. **First Question Fetching**
   - Enhanced first question fetch to try both endpoints (adaptive and regular)
   - Added fallback mechanism to ensure question renders even if one endpoint fails

4. **Error Handling**
   - Added robust error handling for API failures
   - Gracefully handles 404 errors which might indicate test completion

5. **Question Limit Logic**
   - Added `questionsAnswered` and `maxQuestions` state in frontend
   - Added `max_questions` field to TestAttempt model in backend
   - Enhanced `/next_question` endpoint to check question count and return completion status
   - Updated frontend to stop test when maximum questions reached

6. **Results Display**
   - Added summary statistics in results dialog (total questions, correct, incorrect, percentage)
   - Enhanced question display to visually indicate correct and incorrect answers
   - Added explanation display for incorrect answers

7. **Logging**
   - Added detailed logging for debugging purposes
   - Logs question and option formats to help identify issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test the adaptive test interface with different test durations
2. Verify that options display correctly for the first question
3. Test the test completion flow:
   - Normal completion by answering the maximum number of questions
   - Completion due to timeout
   - Manual completion via the "End Test" button
4. Verify that the component handles API errors gracefully
5. Check that the results page correctly shows:
   - Summary statistics (total, correct, incorrect, percentage)
   - Each question with proper marking for correct/incorrect answers
   - Explanations for incorrect answers

## Backend API Requirements

For the adaptive test interface to work correctly, the backend must implement these endpoints:

1. **Regular Question Fetch (First Question)**
   - Endpoint: `GET /tests/{attempt_id}/questions`
   - Used to fetch the first question when starting an adaptive test
   - Should return an array of questions, with at least one question for adaptive tests

2. **Adaptive Next Question (Subsequent Questions)**
   - Endpoint: `POST /tests/{attempt_id}/next_question`
   - Used after submitting an answer to get the next adaptive question
   - Payload should include:
     ```json
     {
       "question_id": number,
       "selected_option_id": number,
       "time_taken_seconds": number
     }
     ```
   - Response should include:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success" | "complete",
       "next_question": { ... } | null,
       "questions_answered": number,
       "max_questions": number
     }
     ```

3. **Test Completion**
   - Endpoint: `POST /tests/{attempt_id}/finish`
   - Used to mark the test as complete

## Option Format Handling

The frontend now handles two formats for question options:

1. **String Array Format**:
   ```json
   "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"]
   ```

2. **Object Array Format**:
   ```json
   "options": [
     { "option_id": 1, "option_text": "Option A", "option_order": 0 },
     { "option_id": 2, "option_text": "Option B", "option_order": 1 },
     ...
   ]
   ```

## Verification Plan

To ensure the adaptive test fixes are working correctly, perform the following verification steps:

1. **Create an adaptive test template**:
   - Navigate to the test template creation page
   - Select "Adaptive" as the test type
   - Configure the test with desired parameters

2. **Start an adaptive test with limited questions**:
   - Select the adaptive test template
   - Choose a question limit (e.g., 10 questions)
   - Start the test

3. **Verify test progression**:
   - Answer questions and observe that the counter increases
   - Check that the display shows "Question X of Y" with the correct numbers
   - Verify that difficulty adapts based on your answers

4. **Verify test completion**:
   - Answer exactly the number of questions specified
   - Verify the test automatically completes after the last question
   - Check that you're redirected to the results page

5. **Verify results display**:
   - Confirm the summary shows correct statistics
   - Verify each question shows correct/incorrect status
   - Check that explanations appear for incorrect answers

6. **Test edge cases**:
   - Try ending the test manually before reaching the limit
   - Test with very low question counts (e.g., 1-2 questions)
   - Test with longer tests (20+ questions)

## Known Limitations

1. The adaptive algorithm currently uses a simple strategy based on previous answer correctness. More sophisticated algorithms could be implemented in the future.

2. The progress indicator shows question count but doesn't indicate estimated difficulty progression.

3. If a user refreshes the page during an adaptive test, the current question may be lost. Consider implementing a recovery mechanism.
