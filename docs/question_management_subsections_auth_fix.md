# Question Management Subsections API Fix

## Issue Description

When adding a new question in the Question Management interface, the following error was occurring:

```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/sections/1/subsections/ 404 (Not Found)
```

This prevented users from selecting subsections when creating or editing questions.

## Root Cause

The issue was identified as an authentication problem in the frontend code. The API endpoint `/api/sections/{section_id}/subsections/` was properly implemented in the backend and registered both with and without the `/api` prefix. 

However, in the frontend's `QuestionManagement.tsx` file, the fetch request for subsections wasn't including the JWT token in the Authorization header, unlike other API calls in the application.

## Solution

### 1. Added Authentication to Subsection Fetch Request

Modified the fetch request in `QuestionManagement.tsx` to include the JWT token in the headers:

```typescript
// Before:
const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/sections/${formData.section_id}/subsections/`);

// After:
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
const response = await fetch(
  `${baseUrl}/api/sections/${formData.section_id}/subsections/`, 
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : '',
    },
  }
);
```

### 2. Created Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation for the subsection API endpoint in `docs/section_subsections_api_documentation.md` that includes:
- Endpoint details
- Authentication requirements
- Request/response formats
- Example usage

## Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Running a test script that confirmed both the `/api/sections/{section_id}/subsections/` and `/sections/{section_id}/subsections/` endpoints were working correctly with authentication
2. Restarting the frontend service and testing the question addition flow

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Consistent Authentication**: Ensured all API calls use consistent authentication patterns
2. **Documentation**: Created detailed API documentation following best practices
3. **Testing**: Created and executed test scripts to validate API endpoints
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Made minimal changes to fix the issue without disrupting other functionality

## Learning Points

1. Always include proper authentication headers for authenticated API endpoints
2. When endpoints are returning 404 errors, check both the endpoint registration and authentication requirements
3. Maintain consistent API patterns across the application
