# Available Question Count Issue Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
The Practice Test feature was displaying the error "No active questions available in this section" for certain sections, particularly when using section_id=4 in paper_id=1. This was due to:

1. The frontend fallback count method was using `page_size=1000`, which exceeded the backend limit of 100
2. The backend was returning a 422 error rather than a 404 when a section didn't exist
3. The frontend wasn't handling these errors properly or providing clear feedback to users

## Complete Solution

### Backend Fixes
1. **Updated error handling in the `/questions` endpoint:**
   - Added explicit validation for paper_id and section_id existence
   - Changed status code from 422 to 404 when a section doesn't exist
   - Added detailed logging to track these validation errors

### Frontend Fixes
1. **Fixed API service:**
   - Reduced page_size from 1000 to 100 to comply with backend limits
   - Added error type tracking in sessionStorage to provide better user feedback
   - Enhanced error handling to identify different error types (404, 422)

2. **Improved PracticeTestPage component:**
   - Enhanced error messages to be more specific based on error type
   - Added cleanup of stored errors when a section becomes available again
   - Improved validation and user feedback

## Testing
These changes were tested with multiple section IDs, including the problematic section_id=4 in paper_id=1.

## Root Cause
The root cause was a combination of:
1. A validation limit on the backend for page_size (must be â‰¤ 100)
2. No proper validation for section existence on the backend
3. Returning the wrong status code for section not found (422 instead of 404)
4. Frontend not handling these errors properly

## Additional Recommendations
1. Consider adding validation in the UI to prevent users from selecting non-existent sections
2. Add database integrity checks to ensure sections referenced in UI actually exist
3. Consider implementing a periodic health check to validate section references
