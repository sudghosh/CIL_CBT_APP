# Practice Test Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Practice Test feature allows users to create custom practice tests by selecting specific papers and sections from the Question Bank. Users can choose the number of questions they want to practice, making it a flexible tool for test preparation.

## Bug Fix Documentation (June 14, 2025)

### Issue
The Practice Test page was displaying the error "Failed to load papers and sections" because the component was using an incorrect API endpoint to fetch paper data.

### Root Cause
The component was using a direct `fetch('/api/papers')` call instead of using the established API service `papersAPI.getPapers()` that's defined in the application's API service module. This resulted in an improper API request that couldn't find the endpoint.

### Fix Implemented
1. Changed the API call from direct `fetch('/api/papers')` to use the proper API service function `papersAPI.getPapers()`
2. Improved error handling and added loading states for better user experience
3. Added a retry button when loading fails to allow users to easily attempt to reload the data
4. Ensured proper cleanup of loading state in all scenarios

### Technical Implementation Details
- Added proper error logging to help with future debugging
- Improved the UI to show meaningful loading and error states
- Fixed the API call structure to match the rest of the application's pattern

## Feature Usage Guide

### Creating a Practice Test
1. Navigate to the Practice Test page from the main menu
2. Select a Paper from the dropdown menu
3. Select a Section from the dropdown menu (this will be filtered based on the selected Paper)
4. Enter the number of questions you want to practice (1-100)
5. Click "Start Practice Test" to begin

### During the Test
- Questions will be presented one at a time
- You can navigate between questions using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons
- You can mark questions for review
- You can see your progress in the Question Palette at the bottom
- When you're ready to finish, click "Submit Test" on the last question or use the Question Palette to navigate to the end

### After the Test
- Your results will be displayed showing your score and performance
- You can review each question to see the correct answers and explanations
- Your test results will be saved and can be accessed from the Results page

## Best Practices
- Ensure API calls use the established service functions rather than direct fetch calls
- Add proper error handling and user feedback for all network operations
- Include loading states to inform users when data is being fetched
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed operations
