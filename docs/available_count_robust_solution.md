# Available Question Count - Robust Error Handling Solution

## Problem Description

The practice test feature was experiencing an error: "No active questions available in this section" when users tried to create practice tests. The backend API endpoint `/questions/available-count` was returning a 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error.

## Root Issues Identified

1. Backend issue: The endpoint was referencing a non-existent field `is_active` instead of the `valid_until` date field that actually determines if a question is active.

2. Error handling issue: Even after fixing the backend code, the 422 errors persisted for certain section IDs, suggesting potential data integrity or configuration issues.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive solution with multiple layers of resilience:

### 1. Backend Improvements

- Updated the endpoint to use `Question.valid_until >= date.today()` instead of `is_active`
- Added detailed parameter validation and error handling
- Improved logging for debugging
- Added graceful handling for non-existent database records

### 2. Frontend API Service Enhancements

- Created a fallback method that uses an alternative approach to count questions
- The fallback method gets all questions for a paper/section and counts them client-side
- Added robust error handling for different error types
- Improved logging for better debugging

### 3. Component-Level Improvements

- Added request timeout handling to prevent UI freezes
- Enhanced caching to avoid repeated failed requests
- Improved error state management
- Added clear user feedback for different error conditions

## Error Resilience Features

The solution includes multiple layers of error resilience:

1. **Fallback Method**: If the dedicated endpoint fails, we use an alternative approach to count questions

2. **Request Timeout**: We set a 5-second timeout to prevent UI freezes if the API is slow to respond

3. **Smart Caching**: We cache successful responses to reduce API calls and avoid repeated errors

4. **Graceful Degradation**: Even when errors occur, the UI provides helpful information to users

5. **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging at every step helps with future debugging

## User Experience Improvements

- Clear error messages when no questions are available
- Visual indicators showing available question counts
- Validation to prevent selecting more questions than available
- Faster UI response through optimized caching

## Testing and Verification

The solution has been tested with various scenarios:

1. Normal case: When the endpoint works correctly
2. Error case: When the endpoint returns a 422 error
3. Timeout case: When the endpoint takes too long to respond
4. Recovery case: When the endpoint fails but the fallback succeeds

## Future Recommendations

1. Investigate why certain section IDs continue to cause 422 errors
2. Add a database maintenance task to repair any data integrity issues
3. Consider adding an explicit `is_active` field to the Question model for clarity
4. Implement server-side caching for question counts to reduce database load
5. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for the entire workflow
