# Adaptive Test Interface Fixes - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes for issues in the adaptive test interface of the CIL CBT Application.

## Issues Fixed (June 17, 2025)

### 1. Options Displaying as Generic Placeholders

**Problem**: In both non-adaptive and adaptive tests, question options were displayed as generic "Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, Option 4" instead of showing the actual option text.

**Root Cause**: The backend was not correctly retrieving option text from the `QuestionOption` model, and instead was assuming the presence of non-existent attributes like `option_1_text` on the `Question` model.

**Fix**:
- Modified the `/tests/questions/{attempt_id}` endpoint to properly query the `QuestionOption` table for option text
- Updated the `TestAnswerResponse` model to correctly retrieve and return option text from the database
- Enhanced frontend option normalization to handle different response formats
- Added robust error handling and better logging
- Created an automated verification script to test option display

### 2. Adaptive Tests Not Ending After Max Questions

**Problem**: Adaptive tests did not end after the specified number of questions were answered, continuing until the time limit was reached.

**Root Cause**: The `max_questions` limit was set in the database, but the test would only end when the time limit was reached, not when the maximum number of questions were answered.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced the `get_next_adaptive_question` endpoint to check if `questions_answered >= max_questions`
- Added automatic test completion and score calculation when the question limit is reached
- Updated the frontend to recognize the "complete" status from the backend
- Added client-side verification of the maximum questions limit
- Added detailed logging to track question count progress

### 3. General Improvements

- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the adaptive test flow
- Improved logging for diagnostic purposes
- Added data normalization to handle inconsistencies between API responses
- Updated question ID handling to work with both formats (id and question_id properties)
- Created verification script (`verify_test_fixes.ps1`) to automatically test the fixes
- Enhanced documentation with detailed implementation and testing information

## Technical Implementation

### Interface Updates
```typescript
// Updated to handle both formats
interface Question {
  id?: number;
  question_id?: number;
  question_text: string;
  difficulty_level?: string;
  topic?: string;
  options: QuestionOption[] | string[];
}

// Normalized option interface
interface QuestionOption {
  id?: number;
  option_id?: number;
  option_text: string;
  option_order: number;
}
```

### Option Rendering
The RadioGroup component was updated to handle multiple option formats:

```tsx
{Array.isArray(currentQuestion.options) ? (
  currentQuestion.options.length > 0 ? (
    typeof currentQuestion.options[0] === 'string' ? (
      // String array format from backend
      (currentQuestion.options as string[]).map((optionText, index) => (
        <FormControlLabel
          key={`option-${index}`}
          value={index}
          control={<Radio />}
          label={optionText}
        />
      ))
    ) : (
      // Object format
      (currentQuestion.options as QuestionOption[]).map((option, index) => (
        <FormControlLabel
          key={option.id || option.option_id || `option-${index}`}
          value={option.id || option.option_id || option.option_order || index}
          control={<Radio />}
          label={option.option_text}
        />
      ))
    )
  ) : (
    // Empty array
    <Typography color="error">No options available for this question</Typography>
  )
) : (
  // Not an array
  <Typography color="error">Invalid options format</Typography>
)}
```

### API Changes
Updated the startTest method to include question count for adaptive tests:

```typescript
startTest: (templateId, durationMinutes, adaptiveOptions) => {
  const payload = { 
    test_template_id: templateId,
    duration_minutes: durationMinutes 
  };
  
  if (adaptiveOptions?.adaptive) {
    payload.is_adaptive = true;
    
    if (adaptiveOptions.questionCount && adaptiveOptions.questionCount > 0) {
      payload.max_questions = adaptiveOptions.questionCount;
    }
    
    // Strategy mapping...
  }
  
  return api.post('/tests/start', payload);
}
```

## Related Changes

- Updated documentation to reflect these changes
- Added debug logging throughout the test process
- Improved error handling with descriptive user messages

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Type Safety**: Proper type checking for all data formats
2. **Defensive Programming**: Added fallbacks for invalid or missing data
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for developers and users
4. **Logging**: Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
5. **Documentation**: Updated docs to explain implementation details

## Future Recommendations

1. Standardize option formats between frontend and backend
2. Add unit tests for both standard and adaptive test interfaces
3. Create a shared question renderer component to avoid code duplication
4. Add visual indicators when options are being loaded to improve user experience
