# Test Interface Fixes Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes made to address issues with the test interface in the CIL CBT Application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Question Options Not Displaying

**Problem**: Radio buttons in the test interface were showing up without any text labels.

**Root Cause**: The frontend component was expecting option objects with `option_id`, `option_text`, and `option_order` properties, but the backend was returning an array of strings.

**Fix**: Updated the `TestInterface` component to handle both formats - string arrays and option objects:
- Updated the Question interface to support both string arrays and option objects
- Added proper type checking and type assertions for TypeScript compatibility
- Added explicit error handling for empty arrays or invalid option formats
- Created explicit rendering logic for each option format
- Added fallback components when options are missing or invalid
- Added diagnostic logging to help with future troubleshooting

### 2. Test Duration Incorrect

**Problem**: The test interface was always showing 180 minutes (3 hours) regardless of the duration set by the user.

**Root Cause**: The duration was hardcoded in both `TestInterface` and `AdaptiveTestInterface` components rather than being passed from the configuration.

**Fix**: 
- Added `testDuration` prop to both test interface components
- Updated the parent `PracticeTestPage` to pass the selected duration to the test interfaces
- Modified the initialization logic to use the provided duration value
- Fixed time calculation in answer submission to use the correct duration

### 3. Extra Questions Displayed

**Problem**: More questions were displayed than requested, e.g., selecting 4 questions but getting more.

**Root Cause**: The backend was returning all available questions for the selected sections without respecting the requested count.

**Fix**: 
- Added filtering logic in the frontend to limit the number of displayed questions
- Added tracking of the total requested question count
- Implemented question slicing to match the requested count

## Implementation Details

### TestInterface Component Changes

1. Updated the component to handle both string array and object formats for options
2. Added a `testDuration` prop with default value of 60 minutes
3. Added initialization of timeLeft based on testDuration
4. Fixed time taken calculation in answer submission
5. Added displayedQuestions state to manage filtered questions

### AdaptiveTestInterface Component Changes

1. Added a `testDuration` prop with default value of 60 minutes
2. Added initialization of timeLeft based on testDuration
3. Fixed timer management

### PracticeTestPage Component Changes

1. Updated to pass testDuration to both test interfaces
2. Added question filtering logic to limit displayed questions to requested count
3. Improved error handling for question fetching

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Type Safety**: Added proper type checking for different data formats
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Added fallbacks for missing or improperly formatted data
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Kept filtering logic in the parent component
4. **Logging**: Added console logs for debugging and tracing
5. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and handling
6. **Documentation**: Created this document to explain the changes

## Additional Fixes (June 16, 2025)

### 1. Options Not Displaying in Adaptive Tests

**Problem**: Options were not displaying for the first question in adaptive tests.

**Root Cause**: In adaptive tests, options were expected in an object format but were sometimes received as a string array.

**Fix**: 
- Updated AdaptiveTestInterface to handle both string arrays and option objects
- Added robust type checking and format handling for options
- Added comprehensive error handling for missing or invalid options
- Implemented normalization of question data between API responses
- Added debug logging to trace option formats for better diagnostics
- Enhanced the RadioGroup component to support both data types with fallback UI

### 2. Question Count in Adaptive Tests 

**Problem**: Adaptive tests didn't respect the requested number of questions.

**Root Cause**: The number of questions requested wasn't being passed to the backend for adaptive tests.

**Fix**: 
- Confirmed that API calls pass the correct question count limit to adaptive tests via `questionCount` parameter
- Verified that the startTest method properly includes `max_questions` parameter for adaptive tests
- Implemented question ID normalization to handle both `id` and `question_id` field formats
- Added error handling for missing question IDs during answer submission

### 3. Bug Fixes in AdaptiveTestInterface

**Problem**: Several minor bugs in the AdaptiveTestInterface component causing potential runtime errors.

**Root Cause**: TypeScript errors and improper handling of optional fields.

**Fix**:
- Fixed duplicate variable declaration in the submitAnswer function
- Added missing dependencies to useEffect hooks
- Improved null/undefined checking for question ID values
- Enhanced the submitTest handler to check for question ID format before submission
- Added additional error handling and logging throughout the component
- Improved type definitions for better TypeScript compatibility

## Future Improvements

1. Option format should be standardized between frontend and backend
2. Add unit tests to verify these fixes
3. Add validation to ensure the test duration is properly set and used throughout the application
4. Update backend API contract documentation to clearly specify the expected format for question options
