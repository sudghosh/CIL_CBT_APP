# Test Start 500 Error Fix Summary (June 17, 2025)

## Issue
Users were experiencing 500 Internal Server Errors when trying to start both adaptive and non-adaptive tests. The error occurred in the `/tests/start` endpoint.

## Root Cause
The backend was trying to set a `max_questions` value in the `TestAttempt` model, but in some database deployments, this column didn't exist. Without proper error handling, this resulted in a 500 error.

## Solution Components

### 1. Database Migration
- Added the `add_max_questions_column.py` script to add the missing column
- Script checks if column exists before adding it
- Migration runs safely on both existing and new deployments

### 2. New Backend Route
- Created `start_route.py` with robust error handling
- Added try/catch blocks around potentially problematic code
- Improved logging for better diagnostics
- Properly registered the route in the FastAPI application

### 3. Deployment Script
- Created `fix_max_questions.ps1` to run migration and restart backend
- Script provides clear status updates during execution
- Makes the fix easy to apply in any environment

## Files Changed
1. `backend/src/routers/start_route.py` (new file)
2. `backend/src/main.py` (updated to include new router)
3. `backend/add_max_questions_column.py` (applied)
4. `docs/test-startup-error-fix.md` (updated)
5. `docs/adaptive-test-fixes.md` (updated)

## Verification
After applying the fix:
- Both adaptive and non-adaptive tests can be started successfully
- No 500 errors appear in the browser console
- Backend logs show successful test starts
- No other functionality was broken by these changes

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Defensive Programming**: Added try/catch blocks and conditional field setting
2. **Clean Migration**: Added a safe, idempotent migration script
3. **Documentation**: Updated relevant docs with fix details
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error reporting and logging

## Follow-up Tasks
1. Add comprehensive database schema validation during application startup
2. Implement automated tests for the test start functionality
3. Add more detailed error reporting to frontend for database-related issues
