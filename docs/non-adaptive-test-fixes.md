# Non-Adaptive Test Interface Fixes

## Overview

This document describes the issues fixed in the non-adaptive test interface and results page of the CIL CBT App. The main issues were:

1. MCQ options not displaying for the first question in non-adaptive tests
2. React warning: "Encountered two children with the same key, `option-undefined`"
3. `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toFixed')` error in ResultsPage.tsx

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: MCQ Options Not Displaying

**Problem:**
In the `TestInterface.tsx` component, the MCQ options were not consistently displaying for questions, especially the first one. This was because the backend sometimes returns options as a string array while the frontend component was expecting an array of objects.

**Solution:**
1. Implemented a robust `normalizeQuestionFormat` function to handle different formats of question options:
   - Properly handles string arrays by converting them to object format
   - Handles missing/null options with sensible defaults
   - Handles edge cases like JSON strings
   - Ensures fallbacks for all required option properties
   - Provides detailed logging for debugging
   - Ensures consistent option structure throughout the test flow

2. Updated the question processing logic with proper deep cloning and error handling

### Issue 2: React Key Warning for MCQ Options

**Problem:**
React was showing a warning: "Encountered two children with the same key, `option-undefined`" because:
- Some options had undefined `option_id` values
- The key generation used fallback values that weren't unique across questions

**Solution:**
1. Improved the unique key generation for option rendering:
   - Included question_id in the key to ensure uniqueness across questions
   - Added better fallbacks for missing option_id values
   - Ensured every option gets a truly unique key

### Issue 2: "toFixed is not a function" Error in ResultsPage

**Problem:**
The `ResultsPage.tsx` component was trying to call the `toFixed()` method on potentially null values of `result.score` and `result.weighted_score`, causing the application to crash.

**Solution:**
Added proper null/undefined checks before calling `toFixed()`, with fallback to default values ('0.00') when score data is missing or invalid.

## Implementation Details

### TestInterface.tsx Changes:

1. Enhanced the `normalizeQuestionFormat` function to handle multiple format scenarios:
   ```typescript
   const normalizeQuestionFormat = (question: Question): Question => {
     const normalizedQuestion = { ...question };
     
     if (!normalizedQuestion.options) {
       console.warn(`Question ID ${normalizedQuestion.question_id} has no options, setting to empty array`);
       normalizedQuestion.options = [];
       return normalizedQuestion;
     }
     
     if (Array.isArray(normalizedQuestion.options)) {
       if (normalizedQuestion.options.length > 0) {
         if (typeof normalizedQuestion.options[0] === 'string') {
           // Convert string array to QuestionOption objects
           normalizedQuestion.options = (normalizedQuestion.options as string[]).map((optionText, index) => ({
             option_id: index,
             option_text: optionText,
             option_order: index
           }));
         } else if (typeof normalizedQuestion.options[0] === 'object') {
           // Already objects, but ensure all required fields are present
           normalizedQuestion.options = (normalizedQuestion.options as any[]).map((option, index) => ({
             ...option,
             option_id: option.option_id ?? option.id ?? index,
             option_text: option.option_text || `Option ${index + 1}`,
             option_order: option.option_order ?? index
           }));
         }
       }
     }
     
     return normalizedQuestion;
   }
   ```

2. Improved FormControlLabel rendering with unique keys:
   ```typescript
   <FormControlLabel
     key={`option-${currentQuestion.question_id}-${optionId}`}
     value={optionOrder}
     control={<Radio disabled={isSubmitting || isSavingAnswer} />}
     label={optionText}
   />
   ```

3. Added deep cloning and better error handling in question processing:
   ```typescript
   // Create a deep copy to prevent any mutation issues
   const questionsCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(questions));
      
   // Normalize all questions to ensure consistent options format
   const normalizedQuestions = questionsCopy.map(q => normalizeQuestionFormat(q));
   ```

4. Added extensive logging to help with debugging format issues

### ResultsPage.tsx Changes:

1. Added null/undefined checks for score values before calling `toFixed()`
2. Added fallbacks to prevent crashes when data is missing

## Best Practices

1. **Type Safety**: Always validate data coming from APIs before using it
2. **Error Handling**: Add checks for null/undefined values before calling methods on them
3. **Normalization**: Convert inconsistent data formats to a standard format as early as possible in the data flow
4. **Logging**: Add detailed logging to help diagnose format-related issues
5. **Fallbacks**: Provide sensible defaults when expected data is missing or malformed

## Testing Recommendations

To ensure these fixes work properly:
1. Test the non-adaptive test flow with various question formats
2. Verify that options display correctly for all questions, especially the first one
3. Test the results page with both complete and incomplete score data
4. Check that no console errors appear during the test-taking and results viewing processes
