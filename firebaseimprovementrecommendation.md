Considering the current state of the application and the analysis we've done, here are some things you could do to further enhance the app, keeping in mind your request to not disturb the core logic but focusing on improvements:

1. Enhance User Experience and UI:

Loading Indicators: Add more granular loading indicators in the frontend (beyond the page-level loading) for specific actions like submitting an answer, saving a question, or uploading a file. This provides better feedback to the user.
Empty States: Design and implement clear empty states for lists or tables when there is no data to display (e.g., "No questions found," "No test attempts yet").
Confirmation Modals: For destructive actions (like deactivating a question), use confirmation modals to prevent accidental data loss. (There is already one for submitting the test).
Notifications/Toasts: Implement a consistent notification system (e.g., using Material UI's Snackbar or a library) to display success messages, warnings, and errors to the user in a non-intrusive way.
2. Improve Code Maintainability and Readability:

Refactor Large Components: Break down large frontend components (like TestInterface or QuestionManagement) into smaller, more manageable components with clear responsibilities.
Consistent Styling: Review and standardize the styling across the application, perhaps by defining a theme or using styled components consistently.
Add Prop Types or TypeScript Interfaces: Ensure all component props and data structures have clear type definitions (which you are already doing with TypeScript, but review for completeness).
Write Unit Tests: Add unit tests for your frontend components and backend endpoints to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions when making changes.
3. Add Non-Core Features (without changing main logic):

User Profile Page: Create a simple user profile page where users can view their basic information (fetched from the backend /auth/me endpoint).
Dashboard/Summary Page: Create a dashboard that shows a summary of the user's activity, such as the number of tests attempted, average score, etc. (This might require adding new, simple endpoints to the backend to fetch this summary data).
Basic Analytics: Implement basic tracking (e.g., using Google Analytics if integrating with Firebase) to understand user behavior and feature usage.
4. Backend Enhancements (without changing core test/question logic):

Input Validation (More Comprehensive): Add more comprehensive input validation in the backend using Pydantic models and FastAPI's validation features to ensure the integrity of data received from the frontend.
Logging: Implement a more structured logging system in the backend to capture information about requests, errors, and key events.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on certain endpoints (e.g., login attempts, answer submissions) to prevent abuse.
Things to AVOID (to not disturb the core logic):

Changing how questions are stored, how tests are scored, or the fundamental relationships between models.
Alterations to the core authentication flow beyond fixing the current Google OAuth issue.
Major refactoring of the database schema that would require significant changes across multiple parts of the application.
By focusing on these areas, you can enhance the application's user experience, maintainability, and add valuable features without altering the fundamental logic of the CBT system.
