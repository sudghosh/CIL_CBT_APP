## Cascade Delete Fix - $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm")

Applied database migration to fix cascade deletion for papers, sections, subsections, and questions.

### Changes Applied:
- Modified Paper and Section relationships to use CASCADE delete
- Updated foreign key constraints with ON DELETE CASCADE
- Removed validation checks that prevented deletion of papers with sections
- Ensured proper cascading of deletions throughout the entity hierarchy

### Migration Script:
- Successfully ran \`run_migrations.py\`
- All database updates were applied without errors

### Verification:
- Backend API health check: Passed
- Service restart: Completed successfully
