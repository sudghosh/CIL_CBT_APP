# Project Performance and Bug Fixing Recommendations
# Project Performance and Bug Fixing Recommendations

This file contains recommendations for improving the performance and fixing potential bugs in the CIL CBT application codebase. These recommendations are based on a code analysis conducted within the Firebase Studio environment.

**Important:** Due to limitations in the development environment, these changes could not be applied automatically. You will need to manually apply these recommendations to your local codebase.

**Instructions:**

1.  Review the recommendations listed for each file.
2.  Manually implement the suggested changes in the corresponding files in your local project.
3.  Run any necessary commands (e.g., database migrations if schema changes related to indexes were recommended).
4.  Thoroughly test the application after applying the changes.
5.  Stage, commit, and push the updated code to your GitHub repository from your local machine using standard Git commands.

## Backend Recommendations

### `backend/src/routers/questions.py`

**Observations:**

*   **Performance:**
    *   N+1 problem and multiple commits in the `/upload` endpoint when processing questions from a file.
    *   Individual `db.add()` calls for question options.
*   **Bugs:**
    *   Broad exception handling and no rollback in the `/upload` endpoint.
    *   Potential data duplication in `/upload` due to reliance on name lookups for Paper and Section.
    *   Hardcoded question type in `/upload`.
    *   Missing subsection handling in `/upload`.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Optimize `/upload` for Batch Processing:** Modify the `/upload` endpoint to read the entire file into a Pandas DataFrame, process it to identify unique Papers and Sections, perform batched inserts/upserts for them, and then use `db.bulk_save_objects()` or `db.bulk_insert_mappings()` for efficient insertion of Questions and QuestionOptions. Perform a single `db.commit()` at the end of successful processing.
    *   **Use `db.bulk_save_objects()` for creating questions and options** in the `/` (create question) endpoint for potentially better performance with multiple options.
*   **Bugs:**
    *   **Implement Database Rollback:** Add `db.rollback()` in the `except` block of the `/upload` and `/` (create question) endpoints.
    *   **Add Data Validation and Cleaning:** Implement robust validation and cleaning of data read from the uploaded file in `/upload`.
    *   **Handle Different Question Types:** If applicable, read the question type from the uploaded file and use it when creating questions in `/upload`.
    *   **Implement Subsection Handling:** Add logic to process subsection information from the uploaded file in `/upload`.
    *   **More Granular Exception Handling:** Replace the broad `except Exception` in `/upload` with more specific exception handling.

## Backend Recommendations

### `backend/src/routers/questions.py`

**Performance:**

*   **Optimize `/questions/upload` endpoint for batch processing:**
    *   Instead of committing within the loop for each paper, section, and question, collect all the new `Paper`, `Section`, `Question`, and `QuestionOption` objects in lists.
    *   After iterating through all rows in the uploaded file and creating all necessary objects, use SQLAlchemy's bulk insertion methods (`db.bulk_save_objects()` or `db.bulk_insert_mappings()`) to add the objects to the database in batches.
    *   Perform a single `db.commit()` after all data has been processed and bulk inserted.
*   **Add Database Rollback in `/questions/upload`:**
    *   Wrap the data processing and insertion logic in a `try...except` block.
    *   In the `except` block, call `db.rollback()` to discard any partial changes to the database if an error occurs during processing.

**Bugs:**

*   **More Granular Exception Handling in `/questions/upload`:**
    *   Replace the broad `except Exception as e:` block with more specific exception handling for potential errors during file reading (e.g., `pd.errors.EmptyDataError`, `pd.errors.ParserError`), data processing (e.g., `KeyError` if expected columns are missing), and database operations (`sqlalchemy.exc.SQLAlchemyError`).
    *   Provide more informative error messages based on the type of exception caught.
*   **Implement Data Validation and Cleaning in `/questions/upload`:**
    *   Add validation checks to ensure required columns exist in the DataFrame and that data types are as expected.
    *   Implement basic data cleaning (e.g., stripping whitespace from strings) to prevent issues like duplicate entries due to variations in spacing.
*   **Handle Different Question Types in `/questions/upload`:**
    *   If your file format supports different question types, read the question type from the file and use it when creating the `Question` object, instead of hardcoding 'MCQ'.
*   **Implement Subsection Handling in `/questions/upload`:**
    *   If your file format includes information about subsections, modify the logic to read this information and set the `subsection_id` when creating `Question` objects.

### `backend/src/routers/tests.py`

**Performance:**

*   **Optimize Question Selection in `/tests/start`:**
    *   Instead of querying all questions matching the criteria with `.all()` and then using `random.sample` in Python, try to select a random sample directly in your SQLAlchemy query. You can achieve this using a subquery and `ORDER BY random()` with a limit.
    *   Example (conceptual, exact implementation might vary based on database):
```
python
        # ... inside start_test endpoint ...
        for template_section in template.sections:
            query = db.query(Question).filter(Question.is_active == True)
            # Add filters based on template_section.paper_id, section_id, subsection_id
            if template_section.paper_id:
                query = query.filter(Question.paper_id == template_section.paper_id)
            if template_section.section_id:
                query = query.filter(Question.section_id == template_section.section_id)
            if template_section.subsection_id:
                query = query.filter(Question.subsection_id == template_section.subsection_id)

            # Select a random sample in the database
            selected_questions = query.order_by(func.random()).limit(template_section.question_count).all()

            # Create blank answers for selected questions (existing logic)
            for question in selected_questions:
                answer = TestAnswer(
                    attempt_id=test_attempt.attempt_id,
                    question_id=question.question_id
                )
                db.add(answer)
        # ... rest of the function ...
        
```
*   **Optimize Data Retrieval in `/tests/get_test_questions/{attempt_id}` and `/tests/attempts/{attempt_id}/details`:**
    *   Use SQLAlchemy's eager loading (`joinedload`) to fetch related `Question` and `QuestionOption` objects in a single query or a reduced number of queries, eliminating the N+1 problem.
    *   Modify the queries to look like this:
```
python
        # ... inside get_test_questions or get_attempt_details ...
        answers = db.query(TestAnswer).filter(
            TestAnswer.attempt_id == attempt_id
        ).options(
            joinedload(TestAnswer.question).joinedload(Question.options)
        ).all()

        # Now you can access question and options directly from the loaded answers
        questions_data = []
        for answer in answers:
            question = answer.question
            options = question.options
            # ... build your response data using the loaded objects ...
            # For get_test_questions, exclude correct answer/explanation
            # For get_attempt_details, include correct answer/explanation and user's answer
            pass # Replace with your data structuring logic

        # ... return the structured data ...
        
```
*   Remove the loops that query for `Question` and `QuestionOption` individually for each answer.
*   **Single Commit in `/tests/templates`:**
    *   Remove the `db.commit()` within the loop that creates `TestTemplateSection` objects.
    *   Perform a single `db.commit()` after adding the `TestTemplate` and all `TestTemplateSection` objects to the session.

**Bugs:**

*   **Make Test Duration Configurable in `/tests/start`:**
    *   Add a `duration_minutes` field to the `TestTemplate` model.
    *   When creating a test attempt in `/tests/start`, use the `duration_minutes` value from the fetched `TestTemplate` instead of the hardcoded 180 minutes.
*   **Implement Database Rollback in `/tests/templates` and `/tests/start`:**
    *   Wrap the data creation logic in both endpoints in `try...except` blocks.
    *   Call `db.rollback()` in the `except` blocks to discard changes if an error occurs.
*   **Clarify `subsection_id` handling in `/tests/start` query:**
    *   Ensure the SQLAlchemy filter correctly handles the case where `template_section.subsection_id` might be `None`. The current `if template_section.subsection_id:` check is correct for applying the filter only when a subsection is specified.

### `backend/src/routers/papers.py`

**Performance:**

*   **Optimize `/papers` endpoint for getting papers:**
    *   Use SQLAlchemy's eager loading (`joinedload`) to fetch `Section` and `Subsection` objects along with the `Paper` objects in a more efficient manner.
    *   Modify the query in the `/` (get\_papers) endpoint like this:
```
python
        papers = db.query(Paper)\
                   .filter(Paper.is_active == True)\
                   .options(joinedload(Paper.sections).joinedload(Section.subsections))\
                   .all()
        
```
*   Remove the manual loops and dictionary creation for sections and subsections. Rely on SQLAlchemy to load these relationships, and ensure your `PaperResponse` Pydantic model is configured to handle the nested structure correctly (using `from_attributes = True` and defining nested models for sections and subsections).
*   **Single Commit in `/papers` endpoint for creating papers:**
    *   Remove the `db.commit()` calls within the loops that create `Section` and `Subsection` objects.
    *   Perform a single `db.commit()` after adding the `Paper`, all its `Section`s, and all their `Subsection`s to the session.

**Bugs:**

*   **Implement Database Rollback in `/papers` endpoint for creating papers:**
    *   Wrap the data creation logic in the `/` (create\_paper) endpoint in a `try...except` block.
    *   Call `db.rollback()` in the `except` block to discard changes if an error occurs.

### `backend/src/database/models.py`

**Observations:**

*   **Performance:**
    *   Missing indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions.
*   **Bugs:**
    *   No schema bugs identified.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Add Database Indexes:** Add `index=True` to the `Column` definitions for the following columns to improve query performance:
        *   `User`: `email`
        *   `AllowedEmail`: `email`
        *   `Paper`: `paper_name`
        *   `Section`: `paper_id`, `section_name`
        *   `Subsection`: `section_id`
        *   `Question`: `paper_id`, `section_id`, `subsection_id`
        *   `QuestionOption`: `question_id`
        *   `TestAttempt`: `user_id`, `status`
        *   `TestAnswer`: `attempt_id`, `question_id`
    *   **Action Required (Manual):** After adding `index=True` to these columns, you *must* run database migrations (e.g., using Alembic) on your local machine to apply these index changes to your database schema.

**Bugs:**

*   No schema bugs identified that require changes to this file.

## Frontend Recommendations

### `frontend/src/components/TestInterface.tsx`

**Performance:**

**Performance:**

*   **Add Database Indexes:** Add `index=True` to the `Column` definitions for the following columns. This will require running database migrations after applying the changes locally.
    *   `User` table: `email`
    *   `AllowedEmail` table: `email`
    *   `Paper` table: `paper_name`
    *   `Section` table: `paper_id`, `section_name`
    *   `Subsection` table: `section_id`
    *   `Question` table: `paper_id`, `section_id`, `subsection_id`
    *   `QuestionOption` table: `question_id`
    *   `TestAttempt` table: `user_id`, `status`
    *   `TestAnswer` table: `attempt_id`, `question_id`

**Bugs:**

*   No schema bugs identified that require changes to this file.

## Frontend Recommendations

### `frontend/src/components/TestInterface.tsx`

**Performance:**

*   **Debounce or Throttle API Calls for Answer Submission:**
    *   Implement a debouncing or throttling mechanism for the `handleAnswerChange` and `toggleMarkForReview` functions. You can use a utility function or a library for this. This will limit how often the `testsAPI.submitAnswer` function is called when the user interacts with the interface.
*   **Optimize Question Palette Rendering (Optional):**
    *   If you encounter performance issues with a very large number of questions in the palette, consider implementing list virtualization using a library like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`. This is a more involved change.

**Bugs:**

*   **Implement Robust API Error Handling with User Feedback:**
    *   Add state variables to track loading and error states for the `submitAnswer`, `finishTest`, and review status update API calls.
    *   Display user-friendly error messages (e.g., using a toast notification system or an `Alert` component) if an API call fails.
    *   Consider implementing a basic retry mechanism for failed submissions, especially for answer saving.
*   **Correct or Clarify Time Taken Calculation:**
    *   If `time_taken_seconds` is intended to be the total time elapsed, rename the variable for clarity.
    *   If it's intended to be the time spent on the *current* question, you'll need to track the start time when a question is displayed and calculate the duration when the user moves to the next question or submits an answer.
*   **Use Dynamic Test Duration for Timer:**
    *   When you fetch the test attempt details (perhaps in a parent component), get the `total_allotted_duration_minutes` from the backend response.
    *   Pass this value down as a prop to `TestInterface` and use it to initialize the `timeLeft` state instead of the hardcoded 180 minutes.
*   **Correct `is_marked_for_review` logic in `toggleMarkForReview` API call:**
    *   After updating the `markedForReview` state with `setMarkedForReview(newMarkedForReview)`, use the `newMarkedForReview.has(questionId)` value (or simply the negated original value if you're sure the state update will be synchronous before the API call) when calling `testsAPI.submitAnswer`.
*   **Consider a more robust state management solution:**
    *   For better management of `answers` and `markedForReview` states, especially with asynchronous API calls, consider refactoring to use the `useReducer` hook or integrating a state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit) when you work on your local machine.

### `frontend/src/components/TestReview.tsx`

**Performance:**

*   **Virtualize Question and Option Lists (Optional):**
    *   Similar to the test interface, if tests can have a very large number of questions, consider implementing list virtualization to improve rendering performance.
*   **Memoize Filtered Statistics (Optional):**
    *   For very large question lists, consider using `useMemo` to memoize the results of filtering the `questions` array for calculating statistics to avoid redundant calculations.

**Bugs:**

*   **Correct or Clarify Incorrect Answer Count:**
    *   Adjust the filtering logic used to calculate the "Incorrect Answers" count based on whether you want to count all questions where `is_correct` is false, or only those where an option was selected and `is_correct` is false. Update the label to accurately reflect what is being counted.
*   **Simplify Option Color Logic:**
    *   Extract the logic for determining the color of the option text into a separate helper function to improve readability and maintainability.

### `frontend/src/pages/QuestionManagement.tsx`

**Performance:**

*   **Implement Pagination and Filtering for Question List:**
    *   Modify the `questionsAPI.getQuestions` function to accept pagination and filtering parameters (e.g., `page`, `limit`, `paper_id`, `section_id`).
    *   Update the `fetchData` function to call `questionsAPI.getQuestions` with the appropriate parameters based on the current pagination and filter state.
    *   Add UI elements for pagination (e.g., a `TablePagination` component) and filtering (e.g., dropdowns for papers and sections).
*   **Optimize Paper and Section Name Lookup in Table:**
    *   When fetching papers in `fetchData`, create a lookup map (e.g., `paperMap: { [paperId: number]: ExamPaper }`, `sectionMap: { [sectionId: number]: { section_name: string } }`) from the fetched data.
    *   In the `TableBody`, use these maps to look up paper and section names by ID instead of using `.find()`. This will change the lookup complexity from linear to constant time.
    *   Alternatively, modify the backend API to return the paper and section names directly with each question in the `/questions` endpoint.
*   **Update Local State After Actions:**
    *   After successful create, update, or deactivate API calls, instead of calling `fetchData()` to re-fetch all questions and papers, update the local `questions` state directly with the data from the API response (for create/update) or by removing the item (for deactivate).

**Bugs:**

*   **Implement Optimistic Updates or State Updates from API Responses:**
    *   For create, update, and deactivate actions, modify the `handleSubmit` and deactivate `onClick` handlers to update the local `questions` state directly after the API call succeeds. Consider implementing optimistic updates for a more responsive UI.
*   **Add More Specific Error Handling and Feedback for Actions:**
    *   Implement state variables to track errors for individual actions (create, update, delete, upload).
    *   Display error messages near the relevant form or button using `Alert` components or a notification system. Clear the error state when the user dismisses the message or tries again.
*   **Add Loading and Error States for Dropdowns:**
    *   Add loading state for fetching papers. Disable the dropdowns and show a loading indicator while papers are being fetched.
    *   Display an error message if fetching papers fails, affecting the dropdown functionality.
*   **Consider a Form Management Library:**
    *   For managing the form state, validation, and submission in the "Add/Edit Question" dialog, consider integrating a form management library like React Hook Form or Formik. This can simplify the form logic and reduce the risk of bugs.

### `backend/src/routers/tests.py`

**Performance:**

*   **Virtualize Question and Option Lists (Optional):**
    *   Similar to the test interface, if tests can have a very large number of questions, consider implementing list virtualization to improve rendering performance.

    *   Add UI elements for pagination (e.g., a `TablePagination` component) and filtering (e.g., dropdowns for papers and sections).
*   **Optimize Paper and Section Name Lookup in Table:**
    *   When fetching papers in `fetchData`, create a lookup map (e.g., `paperMap: { [paperId: number]: ExamPaper }`, `sectionMap: { [sectionId: number]: { section_name: string } }`) from the fetched data.
    *   In the `TableBody`, use these maps to look up paper and section names by ID instead of using `.find()`. This will change the lookup complexity from linear to constant time.

### `backend/src/routers/tests.py`

**Observations:**

*   **Performance:**
    *   N+1 problem in `/start` during question selection.
    *   N+1 problem in `/get_test_questions/{attempt_id}` and `/attempts/{attempt_id}/details` when fetching questions and options.
    *   Multiple commits in `/templates`.
*   **Bugs:**
    *   Hardcoded test duration in `/start`.
    *   No rollback in `/templates`.
    *   Potential for large question list in memory in `/start`.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Optimize Question Selection in `/start`:** Modify the query in `/start` to select a random sample of question IDs directly in the database using a subquery and `ORDER BY random()` (or a database-specific random function). Then, fetch the full question objects for the selected IDs in a single query. This avoids loading all potential questions into memory.
    *   **Optimize Data Retrieval in `/get_test_questions/{attempt_id}` and `/attempts/{attempt_id}/details`:** Use SQLAlchemy's eager loading (`joinedload`) to fetch the related `Question` and `QuestionOption` objects along with `TestAnswer` objects in a reduced number of queries. This eliminates the N+1 problem.
    *   **Single Commit in `/templates`:** Modify the `/templates` endpoint to use a single `db.commit()` after creating the `TestTemplate` and all `TestTemplateSection` objects.
*   **Bugs:**
    *   **Make Test Duration Configurable:** Add a field for `duration_minutes` to the `TestTemplate` model and use this value in the `/start` endpoint when creating a `TestAttempt`.
    *   **Implement Database Rollback:** Add `db.rollback()` in the `except` blocks of the `/templates` and `/start` endpoints.
    *   **Clarify `subsection_id` handling:** Ensure the question selection logic in `/start` correctly handles the case where `subsection_id` might be `None` in a `TestTemplateSection`.

### `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

**Bugs:**

*   **Replace `any` with Specific Types:**
    *   Define TypeScript interfaces or types for the request data and response structures for each API function.
    *   Replace the `any` type annotations with these specific types to improve type safety.
*   **Refine Error Handling Interceptor:**
    *   Consider making the error handling in the response interceptor more granular. You could check for specific error response structures from the backend (e.g., validation errors) and handle them differently.
*   **Make 401 Handling More Flexible:**
    *   Instead of a hardcoded `window.location.href = '/login'`, consider emitting an event or calling a callback function that the authentication context or a router can listen to to handle the 401 (e.g., clearing authentication state and redirecting).

---

### `backend/src/routers/papers.py`

**Observations:**

*   **Performance:**
    *   Significant N+1 problem in the `/` (get_papers) endpoint when fetching sections and subsections.
    *   Multiple commits in the `/` (create_paper) endpoint.
*   **Bugs:**
    *   No rollback in the `/` (create_paper) endpoint.
    *   Manual dictionary creation for the response structure in `/` (get_papers).

**Recommendations:**

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Optimize `/` (get_papers) with Eager Loading:** Modify the query in `/` (get_papers) to use eager loading (e.g., `joinedload(Paper.sections).joinedload(Section.subsections)`) to fetch related sections and subsections efficiently.
    *   **Single Commit in `/` (create_paper):** Modify the `/` (create_paper) endpoint to use a single `db.commit()` after creating the paper, all its sections, and all its subsections.
*   **Bugs:**
    *   **Implement Database Rollback:** Add `db.rollback()` in the `except` block of the `/` (create_paper) endpoint.
    *   **Utilize SQLAlchemy Relationships for Response Structure:** Leverage SQLAlchemy relationships and potentially update the `PaperResponse` Pydantic model to automatically serialize the nested `sections` and `subsections` instead of manually creating dictionaries in the `/` (get_papers) endpoint.

I apologize for the interruption. I will continue the analysis from where I left off, which is the frontend/src/pages/QuestionManagement.tsx file. I will provide the observations and recommendations for this file.

File/Area: frontend/src/pages/QuestionManagement.tsx (Question Management Page)

Observations (Performance):

Fetching All Questions and Papers on Load: The fetchData function fetches all questions and all papers when the component mounts. If the number of questions and papers is very large, this could result in significant initial loading time and memory consumption on the client side.
Linear Search for Paper and Section Names in Table: In the TableBody, the code iterates through all questions and for each question, it uses .find() on the papers and then on paper.sections to get the paper and section names to display in the table cells. This involves a linear search through the papers and sections arrays for every question, which can become slow if the number of questions and papers/sections is large (O(n*m) complexity where n is questions and m is papers/sections).
Re-fetching Data After Every Action: After creating/updating/deactivating a question or uploading questions, the fetchData function is called again to re-fetch all questions and papers. This is inefficient, especially after a single item change.
Observations (Bugs):

Potential for Data Inconsistency After Actions: Re-fetching all data after every action (create, update, delete, upload) can lead to temporary data inconsistencies if other users are making changes concurrently. A more robust approach would be to update the local state with the changes from the API response instead of re-fetching everything.
Limited Error Handling for Individual Actions: While there is a general error state for the page, individual actions like updating or deleting a question only log errors to the console and set a general error message. More specific error feedback for each action would be helpful.
Dropdowns Rely on papers State: The Paper and Section dropdowns in the dialog rely on the papers state. If papers fails to load or is empty, the dropdowns will not function correctly.
Manual Form Data Management: The form data for adding/editing questions is managed manually with useState and spread operators (...formData). While this works for simple forms, it can become cumbersome and error-prone for more complex forms, especially with validation.
Recommendations:

Performance:
Implement Pagination and Filtering: Modify the backend API (questionsAPI.getQuestions) to accept pagination and filtering parameters (e.g., skip, limit, paper_id, section_id). In the frontend component, use these parameters to fetch only the required subset of questions for the current page and filters. Implement pagination controls (e.g., next/previous buttons, page numbers) and filtering UI elements.
Optimize Paper and Section Name Lookup:
When fetching papers, create a lookup map (e.g., paperIdMap, sectionIdMap) from the fetched papers data to allow for O(1) lookup of paper and section names by ID in the table.
Alternatively, modify the backend API to return the paper and section names along with each question to avoid the frontend lookup entirely.
Update Local State After Actions: Instead of re-fetching all data after create, update, or delete actions, update the local questions state with the changes from the API response. For uploads, you might still need to re-fetch or strategically update the state depending on the number of uploaded questions.
Bugs:
Implement Optimistic Updates or State Updates from API Responses: For create, update, and delete actions, consider implementing optimistic updates (updating the UI before the API call completes and rolling back if it fails) or updating the local state with the data returned from the successful API response.
Add More Specific Error Handling and Feedback for Actions: Provide specific error messages to the user for failed create, update, delete, or upload actions (e.g., using an Alert component or displaying error messages near the relevant form fields).
Add Loading and Error States for Dropdowns: Implement loading and error states for the Paper and Section dropdowns to provide visual feedback to the user if the data is still loading or failed to load.
Consider a Form Management Library: For managing form state, validation, and submission, consider using a form management library like React Hook Form or Formik. This can simplify form handling and reduce the risk of bugs.
Please add these observations and recommendations to your firebaseStudioRecommendations.md file manually.

Now, I will proceed with the analysis of frontend/src/services/api.ts.

File/Area: frontend/src/services/api.ts (API Client)

Observations (Performance):

No Obvious Performance Bottlenecks in the API Client: The API client itself, built with Axios, is generally well-structured and doesn't introduce significant performance overhead.
Observations (Bugs):

Broad any Type Usage: The API functions use any for request data and response types in several places.
Generic Error Handling Interceptor: The response interceptor catches all errors and throws handleAPIError(error) without specific differentiation.
Hardcoded Redirect on 401: The interceptor hardcodes a redirect to /login on receiving a 401 status code.
Passing Raw File in uploadQuestions: The uploadQuestions function directly appends the raw File object to FormData.
Recommendations:

Performance:
No specific performance recommendations for the API client itself. Performance improvements will come from optimizing backend endpoints and frontend API usage (pagination, debouncing).
Bugs:
Replace any with Specific Types: Define and use more specific TypeScript interfaces or types for API request and response data.
Refine Error Handling Interceptor: Add more specific error handling logic within the response interceptor or refine the handleAPIError function to handle different types of API errors more gracefully and provide more detailed error information.
Make 401 Handling More Flexible: Instead of a hardcoded redirect, consider a more flexible approach for handling 401 responses (e.g., using a context or a callback function).
Add More Detailed Comments: Add comments to the API functions to describe their purpose, expected data, and response structures.
