Manual fix script for tests.py

This script provides a direct, manual fix for the tests.py file, replacing it with
a corrected version that should not have syntax errors.

The approach is to identify and fix the specific section_id_ref variable issue,
ensure try-except blocks are properly formatted, and fix indentation issues.

This document summarizes the fixes applied to the `tests.py` file.

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **BOM Character Issue**
   - Removed the BOM character (\\ufeff) from the beginning of a line which was causing syntax errors.

2. **Variable Reference Issues**
   - Fixed incorrect references to `section_id_ref` instead of `section.section_id_ref`
   - This was causing validation errors when starting practice tests

3. **Try-Except Block Structure**
   - Fixed incomplete try-except blocks 
   - Ensured proper indentation throughout the file

## Testing Recommendations

After applying these fixes, you should test:

1. Practice test creation
2. Starting practice tests with various configurations
3. Verify that the backend service starts without syntax errors

## Technical Notes

- The variable reference issue was a case of using a direct variable name `section_id_ref` 
  instead of the proper object property `section.section_id_ref`
- Multiple scripts were created to fix different aspects of the file:
  - `fix_tests_py_targeted.py`: Removed BOM and fixed basic structure
  - `fix_tests_py_final.py`: Fixed try-except block nesting
  - `fix_tests_py_manual.py`: Fixed variable reference issues

If errors persist, manual debugging and testing of the service may be needed.
