# Performance Improvements - June 2025

## 1. Reduced Health Check Frequency (Frontend)
- The frontend health check interval was increased from 10 minutes to 30 minutes.
- This reduces the number of `/health` API calls to the backend, lowering backend load and improving frontend responsiveness.
- Implementation: In `App.tsx`, the health check result is now cached for 30 minutes in `sessionStorage`.
- Result: Less frequent polling, faster page loads, and less backend resource usage.

## 2. Backend Endpoint Optimizations
- All endpoints, especially `/questions`, `/questions/upload`, and `/questions/{id}` (PUT), were reviewed for performance.
- Serialization of SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic models is now explicit and efficient, preventing slow serialization and validation errors.
- Logging was added to measure and trace slow requests and serialization steps.
- Bulk operations and transaction handling were improved in upload and update endpoints.

## 3. General Recommendations
- Use pagination for large data sets (e.g., questions) to avoid loading all data at once.
- Monitor backend logs for slow requests and optimize queries as needed.
- Profile frontend rendering if UI is still slow after backend optimizations.

## Summary
These changes collectively reduce unnecessary backend load, improve perceived and actual performance for users, and make the system more robust for both development and production environments.
