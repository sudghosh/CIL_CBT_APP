## Changes Made in Firebase Studio

This file logs the modifications made to the project files within the Firebase Studio environment by the AI assistant. These changes need to be manually applied to the local codebase and committed to the Git repository.

**Instructions:**

1.  Review the changes listed below for each file.
2.  Manually update the corresponding files in your local project with these changes.
3.  Run any necessary commands (e.g., database migrations if schema changes were made).
4.  Stage, commit, and push the changes to your GitHub repository from your local machine.

**File: `.env.dev`**

*   **Description:** Updated the `DATABASE_URL` to use the service name `postgres` instead of `localhost` to work correctly within the Docker network.
*   **Changes:**

**File: `backend/Dockerfile`**

*   **Description:** Changed the default `CMD` instruction to use `uvicorn` with the `--reload` flag, aligning it with the typical local development command used in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
*   **Changes:**
    
```
diff
    FROM python:3.11-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    COPY . .
    -CMD ["gunicorn", "src.main:app", "-k", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
    +CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app", "--reload", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

**File: `backend/src/routers/auth.py`**

*   **Description:** Enhanced error handling and added detailed logging within the `google_auth_callback` function to help debug Google authentication failures. Added specific `try...except` blocks for token verification and database operations, and added `db.rollback()` in database-related error handlers.
*   **Changes:** (See the full revised code provided in the previous turn. The changes involve replacing the existing `google_auth_callback` function with the new version that includes nested `try...except` blocks and more print statements.)

---

**File: `backend/src/routers/questions.py`**

*   **Description:**
    *   Optimized the `/upload` endpoint for batch processing of questions and options to reduce N+1 database queries and multiple commits.
    *   Added database rollback in the `/upload` and `/` (create\_question) endpoints for better data consistency.
    *   Added basic logging to the `/upload` endpoint's exception handling.
*   **Changes:** (Significant changes to the `/upload` endpoint logic and minor additions to `/` endpoint error handling. You will need to manually integrate the batch processing logic based on the recommendations.)

---

### `backend/src/routers/tests.py`

- Optimized data retrieval in `/get_test_questions/{attempt_id}` and `/attempts/{attempt_id}/details` using eager loading (`joinedload`) to eliminate the N+1 problem.
- Optimized question selection in `/start` by fetching a random sample directly from the database using a subquery and `ORDER BY random()`. This avoids loading all questions into memory.
- Modified the `/templates` endpoint to use a single database commit after creating the template and all its sections.
- Added database rollback in the `/templates` and `/start` endpoints for better data consistency in case of errors.

**File: `backend/src/routers/tests.py`**

*   **Description:**
    *   Optimized question selection in the `/start` endpoint to avoid fetching all questions.
    *   Optimized data retrieval in `/get_test_questions/{attempt_id}` and `/attempts/{attempt_id}/details` using eager loading to resolve the N+1 problem.
    *   Modified the `/templates` endpoint to use a single commit.
    *   Added database rollback in the `/templates` and `/start` endpoints.
*   **Changes:** (Significant changes to the database queries in the specified endpoints, and minor additions to the commit and rollback logic.)

---

**File: `backend/src/routers/papers.py`**

*   **Description:**
    *   Optimized data retrieval in the `/` (get\_papers) endpoint using eager loading to resolve the N+1 problem.
    *   Modified the `/` (create\_paper) endpoint to use a single commit.
    *   Added database rollback in the `/` (create\_paper) endpoint.
*   **Changes:** (Significant changes to the database query in `/` (get\_papers) and minor additions to the commit and rollback logic in `/` (create\_paper).)

---

**File: `backend/src/database/models.py`**

*   **Description:** Added indexes to various columns to improve database query performance.
*   **Changes:** (Added `index=True` to the Column definitions for the columns listed in the analysis of this file.)

---

**File: `frontend/src/components/TestInterface.tsx`**

*   **Description:**
    *   Corrected the logic for the `is_marked_for_review` value sent in the `toggleMarkForReview` API call.
    *   Added basic error handling messages for API calls using `Alert`.
*   **Changes:** (Minor adjustments to the `toggleMarkForReview` function and added `Alert` components.)

---

**File: `frontend/src/components/TestReview.tsx`**

*   **Description:** Corrected the logic for counting incorrect answers and added a comment for clarity.
*   **Changes:** (Minor adjustment to the filter condition for incorrect answers and added a comment.)

---

**File: `frontend/src/pages/QuestionManagement.tsx`**

*   **Description:**
    *   Added basic error handling messages for individual actions (create, update, delete, upload) using `Alert`.
    *   Note: Did NOT implement pagination, filtering, optimized table lookup, or state updates from API responses due to complexity and environment limitations. These are noted as recommendations for manual implementation.
*   **Changes:** (Added `Alert` components and logic to display error messages for specific actions.)

---

**File: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`**

*   **Description:**
    *   Added more specific types for some API function parameters and return types where feasible without major code restructuring.
    *   Added comments to some API functions.
    *   Note: Did NOT significantly change the error handling interceptor or 401 handling due to complexity and potential side effects. These are noted as recommendations for manual implementation.
*   **Changes:** (Added type annotations and comments to some API functions.)

### `backend/src/routers/questions.py`

- Optimized the `/upload` endpoint to use batch processing for adding questions and options. Database commits are now done once at the end of successful processing. Added database rollback in the exception block.
